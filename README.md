About the Game

The Chicken–Fox–Grain game is a classic problem that tests logical thinking and planning. You are given a boat and three items that need to cross a river. Since the boat can carry only one item at a time, every move matters.
Leaving the wrong pair together can end the game:
The fox will attack the chicken.
The chicken will consume the grain.
By making smart choices and returning the boat when needed, the player must ensure all items safely reach the destination.

Goal: Complete the crossing without violating any safety rules.
